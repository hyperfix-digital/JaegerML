# JaegerML

This project combines machine learning with embedded devices to develop real-time 'combat-responsive' wireless controllers for playing an included side-scrolling fighting game.

# About

This repository is split into three main sections:

- [deck](./deck/)
- [jaegerml](./jaegerml/)
- [hotqey](./hotqey/)

## Deck

'Deck' referrs to the embedded controllers used to provide input into the JaegerML Game.

## JaegerML

JaegerML represents the game developed to be played using the Decks as inputs. The game is developed in Godot using GodoScript and C++ with GodotNative.

## HotQey

JaegerML HotQey (pronounced hotkey) will be referred to as JaegerML HQ. This software connects both Decks to JagerML so that they can command the game's inputs.
